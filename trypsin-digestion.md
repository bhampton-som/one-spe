Trypsin digestion protocol for One-SPE

Buffers:
1. Digest Buffer: 100mM HEPES pH 8.5, 1% sodium deoxycholate (SDC)
2. Reduction Bufer: 100mM dithiothreitol, 100mM HEPES pH 8.5, 1% SDC
3. Alkylation Buffer: 200mM 2-chloroacetamide (CAA), 100mM HEPES pH 8.5, 1% SDC

Sample considerations:
Components of the sample must not inhibit the enzymatic activity Trypsin.
The sample may contain detergents or polymers that are uncharged or negatively charged.
